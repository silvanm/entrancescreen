# Entrance-Screen

My first Flutter project.

Highly customized screen for the entrance of our appartment showing:

- Know when to hurry up: the next departures of the bus next to our house
- Know if you'll be late for the meeting: the current time and date
- Know what to wear: the temperature outside the house using the Netatmo sensors and API and the
  forecasted temperature and current weather coming from http://meteo.search.ch
- Know whether I need to take the rain gear with me: Rain forecast scraped from
  https://kachelmannwetter.com

Additional feature:
- if the light sensor reports darkness, the display turns off. Reason: The screen can be seen
  through the window. We don't want to attract curious people during the night
